# Circles' different spheres of operation

### Cultural

To the biggest extent, Circles is existential activism. It is a statement and a message that we as humans has survived, lived and largely conquered physical safety on this planet and that it makes no sense for us then to propagate an economic game where we constantly worry about our own basic needs being met.

This aspect of Circles, that of a cultural or political concept, is important in more areas than philosophy, discourse and high-level decisions. Attaining a cultural shift towards this thinking in large groups of people is a necessary platform for Circles to be able to run.

An instance of Circles running is itself also an amplifier of this message. Talking about UBI is one thing, but having it be alive in the flesh somewhere for everyone to see? This is the true strength of Circles, a global conversation starter and itself an argument in this conversation.

### Technological

CirclesUBI exists as one or more apps on smart phones or other devices. It's possible that an app like this is what the term Circles will refer to in everyday usage. A significant part of its early history is in blockchain start-up context and as such has been surrounded by words like product, users, game theory, UX research, etc. Despite this, it might be more correct to look at the app as the tip of the iceberg. The app is the handle of a tool that largely exists in other spaces.

The role of technology in advancing political ideas however, is central. Circles is coming to life in the context of technology suddenly enabling a challenge to state monopoly on money. Some have said of Circles to be the true innovation of blockchains,since it fundamentally challenges the nature of money in an impactful way.

### Research

Circles is based in the belief of the scientific method. Stating a goal, a purpose for money, such as Kate Raworth's dough-nut, allows us to compare how different models live up to that. The will to work on Circles often seems to stem from a belief that UBI can be actually shown to live up better to such goals.

Circles then, as a whole, also exists as a research project, as hypothesis of improvements on money as a tool that are longing for empirical data.

In addition to that, a lot of Circles work consists of establishing a good way of designing Circles itself and therefore it warrants a scientific perspective too. Examples of this are plenty, since so many aspects of Circles are new and untested and the forks in the road are numerous. For instance, a common question for newcomers is, what about inflation? Related to that is issuance rate, and whether different regions should or can have different exchange rates with each other? There are many educated guesses at this point, but we also maintain respect for the fact that we don't yet have the data to answer this truthfully, so instead look for opportunities to research.

In the end, what it means is that Circles has Evolutionary Purpose. It attempts not to be a job for the people working on it, not to make profit and not to convince or conquer in political or business areas. Instead its purpose is betterment of our economic reality in all spheres of life. This requires us to view it as a truth-seeking machine, as research.

### Economics and anthropology

Circles by all means exist in the space of economics, however, it seems to exist in a plane orthogonal to the current usage of the term. The definition usually heard of economy is careful management of limited resources. Economics then is the theory and management of these economies. This definition it fits into. Its role is on a fundamental level though, as it is questioning what value is, what aspects of value is objective, how to deal with its subjectiveness and how we define related terms, like resources. It then attempts to implement the answers in real life.

The issue with the word economics is that it is currently used in a way which has taken it astray from the path of science. In present day economics, there is a pretense that we work with something neutral, only numbers, but it obfuscates the true consequences of the economic logic: these happen in physical reality, oftentimes in very human terms, but increasingly clear, also planetary. The field has let us down and Circles is born out of a collective distrust for its lack of awareness and conversation around some of the most pressing issues.

We also have work in the field of anthropology to guide us, it seems to fit the bill better of looking scientifically at the effects of money. In the field of anthropology it is more natural to question the nature of money, whereas oftentimes in the context of economics this question remains something you make assumptions about that you do not criticize or test.

Of course, anyone trained in economics who does show the ability to question the nature of money is a more than welcome collaborator. We have met many wonderful heterodox economists!

### Governance

Central to the idea of Circles is governance. 

This might not be immediately apparent, but in effect, saying that a human should not have to live up to a richer humans whims in order to be able to survive also means trusting that individual human to live their life well enough without someone else telling them how. This is also known as self-governance.

There are concrete examples of how this self-governance can be realized. For instance, in the current global economic system a political minority might face pressure to keep their voice to themselves, having to worry about dissenting minds with material advantage removing their ability to survive. But with a basic income, no-one can threaten an individual to that degree without making themselves liable to criminal law through threats. The result is arguably better democracy through self-governance in the political field, as well as, incidentally, a more competetive, "free" market in the monetary one.

Governance also comes into play in the implementation of Circles. Who decides on the parameters of a Circles instance and how? How are the decisions enforced? We are here eternally grateful for the work from Elinor Ostrom on commons governance. Just like air, the seas and the planet itself, we realize the global monetary system can not be owned by a select few but has to be treated as commons.

The work on governance stretches all the way back to the very core of the project, with the working group itself realizing it has to reach a structure to organize its own governance in a way that is compatible with the vision. In other words, the Circles Co-operative is modelling its organization around its vision of UBI, self-governance and human values.

Though UBI can also be used for purposes of consumerism, it often seems to have its roots in socialist communities. When talking about self-governance this way, we even reach the territory of anarchism, which asks for non-coercive, non-hierarchical structures of governance. If there is something fundamentally shared between Circles and anarchism, it is giving the individual the freedom at the very least to survive, without coercion involved.
